I created this because it's impossible to find a simple calendar view or subscribe to a calendar from the City of Fort Saskatchewan that shows activities that are happening. I'm not interested in subscribing by email. 

This auto-updates overnight every 3rd night. Can and will break at any moment so no guarantees.
